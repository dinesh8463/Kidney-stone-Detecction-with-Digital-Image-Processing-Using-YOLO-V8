# Kidney Stone Detection using YOLOv8

This project presents a deep learning-based solution for **automatic kidney stone detection** using CT scan images.
The YOLOv8 object detection model is used to identify and localize stones within uploaded medical images.
A Flask-based web app provides a simple user interface to interact with the model.

## Motivation

Kidney stones are a common and painful medical condition.
Manual detection from CT scans is time-consuming and error-prone. 
Automating this process with YOLOv8 helps in early diagnosis and reduces the workload on radiologists.

##  Objectives
- Train a YOLOv8 model for detecting kidney stones in CT scan images.
- Build a Flask web interface for image upload and prediction.
- Provide bounding box visualization if stones are detected.
- Enable binary output: “Stone Present” or “No Stone”.
- Use performance metrics like Precision, Recall, and mAP for evaluation.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: Curated CT scan dataset from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com)
- Split into `train`, `valid`, and `test` folders as per YOLO format.


##  Model Performance

- Evaluated using metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, **mAP**
- Achieved high detection accuracy for binary classification of kidney stones.
